# Integrate FastGraph to Unity 3D

FastGraph is built under several targets to offer the maximum features for each of them.

As a consequence of its wide targeting, it is possible to use FastGraph library under the famous [Unity 3D](https://unity.com/) game engine.

Feel free to consult the dedicated [wiki](https://github.com/brucificus/FastGraph/wiki/Unity3D-Integration) page to get more details.
